        "# TITANIC DATASET\n",
        "#### INTRO\n",
        "Sejarah Titanic merupakan salah satu sejarah terkelam. Pada tanggal 15 April 1912, saat pelayaran pertamanya, kapal yang bahkan dijuluki 'Tidak Dapat Ditenggelamkan' menabrak es di Samudra Atlantik dan kemudian karam. Sayangnya, sekoci kapal tak dapat menampung semua penumpang di dalam kapal karena belum ketatnya regulasi pelayaran pada waktu itu mengakibatkan 1502 dari 2224 penumpang dan kru kapal meninggal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mungkin ada faktor keberuntungan yang mengakibatkan mereka bisa selamat tapi sepertinya juga ada pola dari grup penumpang-penumpang tersebut sehingga lebih memungkinkan untuk selamat. Pada analisa kali ini kita akan membuat model untuk menjawab pertanyaan: 'Grup penumpang seperti apakah yang lebih memungkinkan untuk selamat?' dengan menggunakan data penumpang seperti (umur, jenis kelamin, kelas sosial-ekonomis, posisi mereka di kapal, dll)\n",
        "CASE CATEGORY : BINARY CLASSIFIER\n",
        "\n",
        "#### DATA\n",
        "Data sudah dipisah menjadi 2 bagian yakni `train.csv` dan `test.csv`. Kemudian ada juga data `gender_submission.csv` untuk mengcrosscheck hasil prediksi model dengan jawaban aktual.\n",
        "Pada data penumpang terdapat beberapa feature, yakni:\n",
        "1. PassengerId : Merupakan ID/nomor penanda saja\n",
        "2. Survived : Ini merupakan target kita, data ini merupakan data biner dimana 1 artinya selamat/survived dan 0 artinya meninggal/tidak survive\n",
        "3. Pclass : Tolak ukur status ekonomi dan sosial (1 : kelas atas/kaya, 2: kelas menengah, 3: kelas rendah) \n",
        "4. Sex : Gender penumpang\n",
        "5. Name : Nama penumpang\n",
        "6. Age: umur penumpang\n",
        "7. SibSp : Jumlah saudara dalam kapal \n",
        "8. Parch : jumlah anak/orang tua dalam kapal\n",
        "9. Ticket : hanyalah nomor unique ticket\n",
        "10. Fare : Harga tiket\n",
        "11. Cabin : Nomor kabin penumpang\n",
        "12. Embarked : Pelabuhan keberangkatan penumpang (C: Cherbourg, Q: Queenstown, S: Southampton)\n",

        "Pada datasate kali ini kita akan mencoba dan membandingkan 4 model yakni: `SGDClassifier`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, `Random Forest Classifier` dan `GradientBoostingClassifier` untuk melihat performa dari keempat model sebelum ditunning. Kemudian kita akan melakukan tunning dengan bantuan `GridSearchCV` untuk mengoptimalkan hyperparameter dari masing-masing model, dan barulah setelah itu kita seleksi model terbaik untuk tahap selanjutnya."

        " Berdasarkan hasil analisa diatas ternyata tingkat keselamatan penumpang bukanlah hanya keberuntungan semata. Status penumpang seperti umur, gender, level ekonomi-sosial memiliki dampak terhadap survivability rate penumpang. Tidak hanya itu, kita juga bisa melihat bahwa travelling behavior penumpang (travelling solo atau group) serta posisi tinggal penumpang dalam kapal memiliki dampak terhadap tinggak keselamatan dirinya.\n",
        "\n",
        " Spesifiknya berikut adalah penumpang-penumpang yang memiliki peluang selamat besar:\n",
        " 1. Mereka yang berpergian sendirian tanpa grup\n",
        " 2. Merupakan Gender wanita\n",
        " 3. Berumur tidak lebih dari 45 tahun\n",
        " 4. Tinggal di kompartemen A dan B serta berada di kamar-kamar yang memiliki nomor rendah\n",
        " 5. Berasal dari status ekonomi yang kaya atau menengah ke bawah.\n",
        "\n",
        " Kemudian dengan menggunakan Machine Learning, kita bisa membuat sebuah model yang bisa memprediksi apakah penumpang tersebut selamat atau tidak. Dalam kasus ini 2 model (yakni `RandomForestClassifier` dan `GradientBoostingClassifier`) memiliki performa terbaik dari 2 lainnya (`SGDClassifier` dan `KNeighborsClassifier`), masing-masing dengan nilai akurasi.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "##### TO-DO LIST:\n",
        "1. Explorasi lagi dengan Feature Engineering data-data NaN diatas, misalnya untuk umur diprediksi dengan mean(), ffil() dll namun dibuat kolom baru yang diberi flag 'Not-Labeled' untuk memberitahu komputer walaupun data NaN sudah diisi dengan data tapi tetap masuk kategori tidak ada label, apakah akan memberikan dampak signifikan untuk menaikan nilai akurasi model.\n",
        "2. Coba gunakan XGBoost model, apakah lebih baik dari semuanya.\n",
        "3. Bisakah kita meningkatkan performa model SGDClassifier dan KNeighborsClassifier dengan menggabungkannya memakai teknik ensemble Bagging-and-Pasting"
