# Machine Learning Branch
Feel free to roam these branches. They're all collections of my project in several datasets.
All of these projects are written in Python language and you have to open it with Jupyter Notebook application.
You can install Jupyter Notebook either via VSCode or you can just open it in Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
Please pay attention with the Libraries Requirement, you may not have the libraries that I use and therefore have to be installed with 'pip install' command.
You can also download the train and testing file from Kaggle dataset link that I have provided in each project folder. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.

Of course most of those projects may have room for improvement, so feel free to comment and notify me if I'm doing anything incorrectly or if there's any better solution.
Thank you.
